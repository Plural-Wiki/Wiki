'The Last Night' explored the profound societal and existential questions arising from the advance of artificial intelligence (AI) and technology. It delves into the implications of a future where humans transition from workers to beings of leisure (homo ludens), grappling with the challenges posed by AI, which can generate personalized content, making shared pop culture obsolete. The game explores how these advancements affect various facets of life including education, friendship, love, sexuality, personal and collective identity, as well as political and social structures. Through 'The Last Night', Soret aims to provoke thought and discussion on these critical issues, hinting at a future that could be filled with existential angst, loneliness, and a struggle for meaning amidst rapid technological evolution.
